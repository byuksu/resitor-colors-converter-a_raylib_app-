# Resistor Color Code Converter Application

## Project Description
The Resistor Color Code Converter is an interactive application that allows users to select three colors to view the corresponding resistor value or enter a resistor value to display the three colors that represent it. This application is useful for both electrical engineers and hobbyists interested in electronics.

## Features
- **Color Selection:** Users can select three different colors to determine the resistor value.
- **Value Input:** Users can input a specific resistor value to see the three corresponding colors.

## Usage
When the application is launched, two buttons are presented to the user:

- **Color Selection:** By clicking this button, the user can select three colors. The selected colors are displayed on the screen, and the corresponding resistor value is calculated.
- **Value Input:** By clicking this button, the user can enter a resistor value. The three colors corresponding to the entered value are displayed on the screen.

## Application Functionality
- **Startup:** When the application starts, a window opens, displaying two buttons.
- **Color Selection:** The user clicks the Color Selection button to choose three colors from a color wheel. When a selection is made, the chosen colors and their values are displayed on the screen.
- **Value Input:** The user clicks the Value Input button to enter a number in a text box. The corresponding three colors for the entered value are calculated and shown on the screen.
